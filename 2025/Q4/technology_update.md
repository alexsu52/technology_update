- **KVLinC: KV CACHE QUANTIZATION WITH HADAMARD ROTATION AND LINEAR CORRECTION** (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05373v1)
KVLinC is a framework designed to mitigate attention errors arising from KV cache quantization. The authors integrate two complementary techniques to enable robust low-precision caching. First, through a detailed analysis of Hadamard rotation-based quantization strategies, they show that applying channel-wise quantization to raw keys and token-wise quantization to Hadamard-transformed values minimizes quantization error. Second, to address residual errors from quantized keys, they propose lightweight linear correction adapters that explicitly learn to compensate for distortions in attention. Extensive evaluation across the Llama, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3 model families demonstrates that KVLinC consistently matches or surpasses strong baselines under aggressive KV-cache compression. Finally, the authors develop a custom attention kernel that delivers up to 2.55× speedup over FlashAttention, enabling scalable, efficient, and long-context LLM inference.

- **THINKV: THOUGHT-ADAPTIVE KV CACHE COMPRESSION FOR EFFICIENT REASONING MODELS** (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.01290v1).
ThinKV is a KV cache compression framework for LRMs on tasks like coding and mathematics. It classifies CoT tokens into Reasoning (R), Execution (E), and Transition (T) based on attention sparsity (T > R > E) using an offline calibration phase with Kernel Density Estimation to determine sparsity thresholds. The framework employs two main strategies:

  * Think Before You Quantize: assigns token precision by importance. R/E tokens use 4-bit NVFP4, T tokens use 2-bit ternary, with group quantization (g=16) and shared FP8 (E4M3) scales; keys are quantized per-channel, values per-token. Outlier Transition thoughts are recognized as vital for backtracking and preventing model loops. Token importance is measured via KL divergence of the final answer distribution when a thought segment is removed.
  * Think Before You Evict: a thought-adaptive eviction scheme aligned with PagedAttention. K-means clustering on post-RoPE key embeddings retains cluster centroids and corresponding values for evicted segments.

Experimental results show near-lossless accuracy and up to a 5.8× improvement in inference throughput, while utilizing less than 5% of the original KV cache memory. It operates at an average precision of 3.4–3.8 bits.

- **Sparse VideoGen2: Accelerate Video Generation with Sparse Attention via Semantic-Aware Permutation** (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18875).

SVG2 is a training-free sparse attention method designed to accelerate video generation in DiT-based models. Its core idea is to use semantic-aware permutation to better identify critical tokens and reduce unnecessary sparse-attention overhead.
The method introduces three key techniques:
  * Semantic-aware permutation: k-means clustering is applied to the Q/K/V vectors of each head and layer, and tokens are permuted by cluster to form semantically coherent blocks, improving the accuracy of critical-token detection.
  * Dynamic top-p critical-token selection: Cluster centroids approximate attention scores, and clusters (and their tokens) are selected until the cumulative probability reaches p, enabling dynamic compute budgeting.
  * Customized sparse-attention kernels: Since semantic-aware clusters vary naturally in size, custom kernels are used to support dynamic block sizes, which fixed-size sparse kernels cannot handle efficiently.
    
This approach achieves up to 2.30× and 1.89× speedups while maintaining PSNRs of 30 and 26 on HunyuanVideo and Wan 2.1, respectively.

### Software
- KernelFalcon: Autonomous GPU Kernel Generation via Deep Agents (https://pytorch.org/blog/kernelfalcon-autonomous-gpu-kernel-generation-via-deep-agents/) - a deep agent architecture for generating GPU kernels that combines hierarchical task decomposition and delegation, a deterministic control plane with early-win parallel search, grounded tool use, and persistent memory/observability. KernelFalcon is the first known open agentic system to achieve 100% correctness across all 250 L1/L2/L3 KernelBench tasks.
