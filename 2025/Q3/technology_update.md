The paper "Radial Attention" introduces a sparse attention mechanism to optimize long video generation. Its core method reduces computational complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n \log n)$ using a static mask inspired by "Spatiotemporal Energy Decay," where attention focuses on spatially and temporally closer tokens. This architecture is highly optimized for inference. It delivers up to a **3.7x speedup** on extended-length videos compared to standard dense attention, without any discernible loss in visual quality. For a concrete 500-frame, 720p video, the mechanism slashes the raw attention computation by a factor of 9x. The industrial impact is significant. Designed as a "plug-and-play" module, Radial Attention can be integrated into powerful pre-trained models like Wan2.1-14B and HunyuanVideo through efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning.
