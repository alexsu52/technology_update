## Disclaimer and call for collaboration 

As AI research grows and becomes widespread, finding notable results amongst the constantly increasing flow of published papers is getting harder. As we progress with our development, we look into state-of-the-art approaches but cannot cover them all. We aim to share what we have learned and ask you to hint if you see something interesting – let us know!

Thanks to Alexander Kozlov, OpenVINO, NNCF and Intel Labs for the support.
