# Technology update – Low precision and model optimization 

## Disclaimer and call for collaboration 

As AI research is growing and becoming widespread, it is getting harder to find notable results amongst the constantly increasing flow of published papers. As we move with our development, we are looking into some of it but cannot cover it all. We intend to share what we have learned with you and ask you to hint if you see something interesting – let us know!
